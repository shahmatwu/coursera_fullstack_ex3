          Itaque labore impedit error? Quisquam, voluptatem? Steps to Become an
          Image Consultant Let's learn about the steps it takes to become an
          image consultant. Step 1: Complete a Training Program No standard
          education requirements exist for image consultants, but training
          programs are available in the field. These programs may cover certain
          aspects of fashion, such as colors and business wear, as well as areas
          such as nutrition and communication. Some image consultants may pursue
          a degree in mass communication or public relations, which provide
          information on effective interpersonal communication, public speaking
          and relaying specific messages. Additional courses in marketing and
          finance can help independent consultants effectively promote their
          services to clients and operate a budget. Step 2: Gain Work Experience
          Prospective image consultants may first gain experience working with a
          public relations or fashion marketing firm to understand how image
          affects the overall branding of a client. These opportunities can also
          help consultants to learn about targeted audiences and how companies
          and people project a certain image. They may also start their careers
          by working as part-time consultants until they can create a portfolio
          and build their clientele. Potential clients include businesses
          looking to improve the quality of their workers' dress style and
          celebrities who need styling services for an event. Public figures,
          such as politicians, may also hire image consultants to develop a
          presentable look before an appearance. Any company that deals with
          fashion may use image consultants for various projects. Step 3: Join a
          Professional Organization Groups such as the Association of Image
          Consultants International offer networking, continuing education and
          certification opportunities to their members. Image consultants who
          join these types of organizations may be able to further their
          careers. To become an image consultant, you'll need to complete a
          training program and gain experience in the field.
